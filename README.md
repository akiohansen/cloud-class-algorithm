Simple cloud classification algorithm for numerical atmospheric models

The cloud classification algorithm uses the temperature, dew point and hydrometeor profiles of numerical atmospheric models like COSMO-DE, ICON, WRF or any other weather/climate forecast model to generate a cloud classification providing a very intuitive and comprehensive view on the vertical cloud structure and phase. The classification is furthermore consistent to the Cloudnet Target classification, which is a syngertic observational product based on remote sensing measurements of a cloud radar, LiDAR and a microwave radiometer. The algorithm can be used to generate a surrogate of the Cloudnet Target classification which can be used for various statistical cloud and model evaluation studies.
